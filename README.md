- OAS document for Fulfillment API v2 and Metering service API, https://github.com/microsoft/commercial-marketplace-openapi 
- Client library for .NET, https://github.com/microsoft/commercial-marketplace-client-dotnet
- Client library for Java, https://github.com/microsoft/commercial-marketplace-client-java
- Client library for Python, https://github.com/microsoft/commercial-marketplace-client-python, [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/azuremarketplace/)

- Client library for Go (coming soon), https://github.com/microsoft/commercial-marketplace-sdk-go

### Basic integration and manual onboarding sample (a.k.a. Contoso sample)

Some solutions require out-of-band or manual on-boarding steps, such as validating a customer, running scripts manually for deploying resources needed for a new customer etc. This sample uses email notifications for a new customer, or any changes on the subscription status made outside of the solution code.

### Single Page Application sample demonstrating client side Azure Active Directory Single Sign on

This sample addresses a very narrow case to demonstrate the AAD SSO on the client side, with a server side component calling the marketplace APIs.

### Sample for customer registration, provisioning and subscription management (a.k.a. Microsoft Commercial Marketplace transactable SaaS offer SDK)

The sample code provides a framework for excercising the commercial marketplace billing system, including the SaaS Fulfillment API (v2) and Marketplace Metering Service API. This sample code demonstrates how a typical SaaS platform interacts with the marketplace APIs in order to provision subscriptions for customers, enable logging, and manage commercial marketplace subscriptions. It provides both a customer registration experience and a web interface for the publisher to manage the customer subscriptions.

## Azure application offers - Azure managed applications

### Custom metering, retrieving "resourceId" for a subscription

There are multiple approaches when a managed application needs to post usage to metering service. This set of notes and samples go through those approaches, and explain the relationship between them.
